# Calculator-application-
calculator application in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

We first import the Scanner class from the java.util package to read user input from the console.

We then create a Scanner object named scanner.

We prompt the user to enter two numbers and an operator. The user input is read using the Scanner object and stored in the num1, num2, and operator variables respectively.

We use a switch statement to perform the arithmetic operation based on the operator entered by the user. The result is stored in the result variable.

We print the result to the console using System.out.println(). The output shows the two numbers entered by the user, the operator, and the result of the arithmetic operation.

The program then exits.
